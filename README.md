# FightClubPlanner

This application helps MMA tournaments manage their scheduled fights better while ensuring covid safety standards.
The managers are able to create a tournament and invite fighters to sign up for a venue. Each tournament requires at least bi-weekly matches to generate traction and revenue within the tournament period.
After they sign up, in order to ensure proper safety standards, fighters are required to present themselves at a tournament isolation bubble with a test which will be recorded and they will immediately be tested again on site. If the “arrival” test is positive the fighter is then moved to quarantine until the test results are negative again.
In order for a fighter to take part in a tournament they require at least 3 weeks of negative test history after which they can be matched up with similar fighters of their caliber.
A manager is able to see in real time the tournament schedule being populated with eligible fighters (at least bi-weekly).

Uses a DI Container, ORM Mapper (Entity Framework Core).
